# ArtifactVault
ArtifactVault is an open-source artifact repository manager built with Spring Boot and Java. It is a lightweight, open-source platform for storing, versioning, securing, and replicating binaries and artifacts across multiple repositories

## 🚀 Why ArtifactVault?

Modern software development relies on binaries, artifacts, and models — not just source code.
Yet most artifact management solutions are either **too heavy, too complex, or locked behind costly enterprise licenses**.

**ArtifactVault** is built to change that.

### 🔹 Key Advantages

* **💡 Simple & Lightweight**
  Runs on Spring Boot with H2/Postgres — install in minutes, not hours.

* **📦 Universal Artifact Support**
  Manage JARs, Docker images, ML models, IoT firmware, and more.

* **🕒 Version Control Built-In**
  Track versions of every artifact, automatically.

* **🔒 Secure by Default**
  Metadata validation, checksum verification, and extensible security policies.

* **🌍 Distributed & Scalable**
  Supports multi-repo replication and synchronization across environments.

* **🧩 Extensible Architecture**
  Built on Spring Boot — easy to integrate, extend, or adapt to your workflow.

* **🤝 Community-First, Always**
  100% open-source core. Contributions are welcome, and the roadmap is transparent.

### 🔮 The Vision

ArtifactVault is more than just an artifact store.
It’s a **developer-centric platform for the entire software supply chain**, with planned support for:

* ✅ Peer-to-peer artifact replication
* ✅ Built-in vulnerability scanning (using open databases)
* ✅ Secure ML model management
* ✅ IoT firmware distribution and updates
* ✅ Enterprise-ready security & RBAC (future commercial tier)

⚡ In short:
ArtifactVault gives you a **secure, extensible, and cost-effective way to manage artifacts** — whether you’re a solo developer, a growing startup, or an enterprise.
